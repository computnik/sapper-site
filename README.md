Hi. Iâ€™m Nikhil. I am a Software Engineer from Bengaluru, India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³.

## About me
Iâ€™m a Staff Software Engineer (Tech Lead & Software Architect) living in [Bangalore, India](https://bengaluruurban.nic.in/en/). Currently I spend my days working for [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) in Commerce Solutions domain, working to build and scale PayPal Commerce Platform Services like PayPal Shipping for Small & Medium Businesses.

I spend my days with my hands in many different areas of full stack development from back end programming in [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) to front end engineering with [react](https://reactjs.org/).

Iâ€™m extremely passionate about full stack development all its forms and helping the community via some open source contributions. Aside from programming, I enjoy spending my time with my friends, watching TV Series, gaming, and travelling.
